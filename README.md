# Zephyr Squad reporter for Playwright

Publish Playwright test run on Zephyr

## Install

```sh
npm i -D playwright-zephyr-squad
```

## Usage

Add **Server** reporter to your `playwright.config.ts` configuration file

```javascript
// playwright.config.ts
{
  ... // <--- others configs
  reporter: [['playwright-zephyr-squad', {
     host: '',
      projectKey: '',
      accountId: '',
      accessKey: '',
      secretKey: '',
  }]],
}
```
If your test cycle requires custom fields, you can specify them in `testCycle` option:

```javascript
// playwright.config.ts
{
    ... // <--- others configs
    reporter: [
    ['playwright-zephyr-squad', {
       host: '',
      projectKey: '',
      accountId: '',
      accessKey: '',
      secretKey: '',
      testCycle: {
          name: `Automated Playwright Run - ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
          customFields: {
            Browser: 'Google Chrome',
            Device: 'MacOS',
          },
        },
    }],
  ],
}
```

Also, your playwright tests should include unique ID inside square brackets `[J79]` of your Zephyr test case:

```typescript
//      â†“  Zephyr test case ID inside square brackets
test('[J79] basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  const title = page.locator('.navbar__inner .navbar__title');
  await expect(title).toHaveText('Playwright');
});
```

Then run your tests with `npx playwright test` command and you'll see the result in console:

```sh
âœ… Test cycle JARV-C2901 has been created
ðŸ‘‡ Check out the test result
ðŸ”— https://jira.your-company-domain.com/secure/Tests.jspa#/testPlayer/JARV-C2901
```

And you'll see the result in the Zephyr:
